% The cores of the machine

%%%   Tasks    %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The tasks the application is made up of, which are to be scheduled.

%% Dependencies %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The execution order dependencies between tasks
% depends_on(Ta,Tb,Data): before task 'Ta' can be executed, 
% task 'Tb' must have been executed and thereafter 'Data' megabytes of data (result of/produced by 'Tb') must have been moved from the processor that executed 'Tb' to the processor that will execute 'Ta'.

%In this benchmark there are no dependencies between tasks.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%   Processing Costs   %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Specifies how long the processing of each task takes on each core.
% process_cost(T,C,Time): It takes 'Time' ms to execute task 'T' on core 'C'.

%In this benchmark c1,c4 processes tasks 10% faster/slower than c2 & c3 respectively.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%  Channel Properties  %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Specifies the properties of the communication channel between each of the cores
% channel(Ca,Cb,Latency,Bandwidth): The channel to communicate from core 'Ca' to core 'Cb' has a latency 'Latency' and bandwidth 'Bandwidth'.
% Note that sending 'X' megabytes of data, over a channel, takes Latency + X/Bandwidth ms.

%In this benchmark (without task dependencies), no inter core communication is required, the channel properties therefore do not matter.
channel(C1,C2,0,1) :- core(C1), core(C2).
